# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

## Overview
The dataset and script published in this repository is part of the Coursera Course "Getting and Cleaning Data" project assignment.
The purpose is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

As input, we have data gathered from Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) experiments. 
It observed 30 volunteers performin 6 different human activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)  wearing the smartphone (with its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope) on their waist.
