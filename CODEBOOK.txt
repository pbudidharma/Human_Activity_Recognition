GETTING & CLEANING DATA PROCESS FOR HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION USING SMARTPHONE
================================================================================

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
--------------------
This data is gathered from an experiments of 30 volunteers performing various activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) as captured by accelerometer and gyroscope embedded in the Samsung Galaxy SII smartphones. It captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at constant rate of 50Hz.
The dataset is split into 2 categories: 70% of volunteers for training data, 30% for test data
 
Some pre-processed steps had been applied to the data. For more information on this and the project itself, visit:

INPUT DATA INFORMATION:
-----------------------

The dataset provided as input for this project was downloaded from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

For this, we are focusing on the following information:
1. Subject who carried out the experiment (subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt)
2. Measured features (X_train.txt, X_test.txt)
3. Activity types(y_train.txt, y_test.txt)

Files supporting information above:
1. Names of features being measured (features.txt)
   NOTE: 
    - t*Acc-XYZ and t*Gyro-XYZ: t denotes time domain. Acc refers to accelerometer Gyro refers to gyroscope. X, Y and Z are directions.
    - f*Acc* and f*Gyro*: f denotes frequency domain.
    - the acceleration signal is separated into body and gravitiy signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ)
    - Calculated variables:
       	mean(): Mean value   std(): Standard deviation   mad(): Median absolute deviation max(): Largest value in array
       	min(): Smallest value in array   sma(): Signal magnitude area   iqr(): Interquartile range 
       	energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values	entropy(): Signal entropy
       	arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
	correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
	maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
	meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
	skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 	kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
	bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
	angle(): Angle between to vectors.
         
2. Names of activities being observed (activity_labels.txt)


DATA CLEANING PROCESS INFORMATION:
----------------------------------

STEP 1: READ the required data (lookup data, training and test dataset) and RENAME variables to the more descriptive names.
         
STEP 2: MERGE training and test dataset into one data frame called join.data

STEP 3: EXTRACT mean and std feature measurements only - based on the feature names that contains 'mean' or 'std'.

STEP 4: SUBTITUTE activity ID with the appropriate activity names as in activity_labels.txt

STEP 5: GENERATE dataset with average of each variables for each activity for each subjects
        RENAME the feature names by adding "Mean_" indicating that it's the average values of that feature measurements per subject per activity
        WRITE data to a text file (final_data.txt) with "tab" as separator
